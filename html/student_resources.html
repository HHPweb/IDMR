	<h4>Student Resources in Interior Design and Merchandising</h4>
	<p>Our facilities contain a number of physical resources to enhance our students learning experiences. Such resources include three design labs, a textile lab, resource room, and CAD computer lab. These areas are utilized for both instructional and student work. We also have a specific classroom that is utilized for some of our merchandising classes that specialize in topics dealing with fashion. Students utilize these resources to complete specific class projects and assist in developing their portfolios.</p>
	<h5>CAD Lab</h5>
	<p>The College of Human Ecologyâ€™s Computer-Aided Design (CAD) Lab is used by Interior Design and Merchandising students for classroom instruction and projects. The lab has 20 desktop computers which have the following software installed: Auto CAD, Sketch-up, and PhotoShop. The lab also has two large format plotters, laser printers, and scanners. Lab hours vary throughout the semester due to class instruction and necessity, but the lab is generally open most of the week and some weekends. The lab is located on the second floor of the Rivers building in room 254.</p>
	<h5>Design Studios</h5>
	<p>Design Studios are used in the development of an art foundation, mechanical and digital graphics development, and two- and three-dimensional modeling skills. These studios are utilized for both instruction and student work areas. Studios are equipped with individual drafting tables and wall space for display and review of student work. Many also have computers available for working on electronic elements of certain assignments.</p>
	<h5>Textile Lab</h5>
	<p>Textile Analytical Lab is a facility for merchandising students to study textiles through hands-on experiments. While utilizing the lab, students are able to learn and practice fiber identification methods. A high-end microscope with digital imaging software allows students to measure fiber and save digital images of these fibers. By handling, observing and collecting different yarns and fabric samples into their swatch book, students become familiar with different yarn types, fabrication types, finishing, and coloration methods applied to fabrics. In addition, the textile sample collections in the lab assist students with their class project needs in other merchandising classes.</p>
	<h5>Community Outreach</h5>
	<p>Our department offers many opportunities for students to volunteer in community outreach activities. We have partnered with the organization Rebuilding Together to provide students an opportunity to directly impact Greenville and surrounding communities. Past projects have included upgrades and renovations to homes belonging to older adults who cannot afford the major repairs that need to take place. Other such opportunities that are integrated in our Interior Design curriculum have included designing: Barracks for Wounded Warriors, renovations to popular bistros and restaurants, and a heritage center for the Eastern NC Woodland Indians. By integrating such projects within our curriculum, we feel it provides students with direct client interaction and hands-on experience.</p>
