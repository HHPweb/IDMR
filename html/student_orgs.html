	<h5>Interior Design</h5>
	
	<p>As a student in the interior design program, it will be to your benefit to join professional associations including the American Society of Interior Designers (ASID), the International Interior Design Association (IIDA), the International Furnishings and Design Association (IFDA), and the National Kitchen and Bath Association (NKBA).</p>
	<p>These associations assist with careers, networking, and resourcesâ€”valuable tools while you are in school and after graduation. These organizations also help sponsor field trips to major furniture markets, opportunities to travel abroad to see contemporary and historic interiors and architecture, and conferences with clients for design projects.</p>
	<p>Call the office of the chair of the Department of Interior Design and Merchandising at 252-328-6929 for information on student organizations.</p>
	
	<h5>Merchandising</h5>
	
	<p>The Apparel and Interior Merchandising Organization (AIMO) provides opportunities for students to learn more about careers, meet professionals in the field of merchandising, socialize with students who have similar interests, participate in service activities, organize annual fashion show, and participate in terrific field trips.</p>
	
	<p>So far this year:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>We have raised funds for Our Military Kids through ECU Military Appreciation T-shirt designed by our students</li>
		<li>Our fifth annual fashion show entitled &quot;Fashion is Queen&quot; was a great success. The show presented current fashion trends from seven local boutiques and wearable art designs by eight students from ECU School of Art and Design.</li>
		<li>We visited NYC to learn more about careers in merchandising and Atlanta to work at America's Mart.</li>
		<li>AIMO donated its annual $500 towards Merchandising Scholarship.</li>
